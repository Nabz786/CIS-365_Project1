# CIS-365_Project1

## Ideas so far:
- Create a defensive type bot and an offensive type bot
  - If we are losing make all bots offensive
  - If we are winning make all bots defensive
- Prioritize the power dots when the enemy has a large number of points
- Probably going to use dijkstra's for path finding as map is small enough to make computation times irrelevant
